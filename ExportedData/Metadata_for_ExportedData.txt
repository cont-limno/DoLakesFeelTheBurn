Overall information
lagoslakeid refers to unique lake identification number in LAGOS-US (https://lagoslakes.org/)
Refer to Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (https://www.mtbs.gov/) for detailed descriptions of burn severity classes and mapping methods. Data used were from 1984-2015 (May 2017 data release).
Low-severity: < 20% vegetation morality
Moderate-severity: 20-70% vegetation mortality
High-severity: > 70% vegetation mortality
Analysis only includes lakes ? 4 ha
